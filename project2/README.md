# Healthy life without sacrifices
#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/MdixobNPgs8>
#### Description:
My programme:
- It will calculate your BMI and indicate whether it is correct or not
- It will give you advice on how to lose weight, maintain the correct defect or gain weight.
- It will show you 10 tips for "healthy living".
- Every day you will be able to enter your weight and height. And then display charts based on that data.

Descripyion of function:,
- The greeting function manages the entire program. It "loops" it and displays and manages the control panel in the program.
- The number_1 function calculates BMI based on user input.
- The number_2 function asks the user to enter a category of advice in the range: losing / maintaining / gaining weight. After selecting the function, the program automatically draws one tip from several available.
- The number_3 function displays a table with 10 tips for a healthy life.
- The number_4 function connects to the sql database, retrieves height and weight from the user. Then, using the number_1 function, it calculates the user's BMI and enters the user's name, current day, weight and BMI into the SQL table. Then the user has the option of displaying two graphs: bmi vs. days and weight vs. days. When displaying charts, the wykres function is used
- The wykres function fetches data from sql database and then generates two charts. A weight vs. date chart and a BMI vs. weight chart.
- Function number_5 exits the program
